##  Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To explore HR data, uncover trends and patterns in employee attrition, and deliver actionable insights through dynamic visualizations and predictive analysis.

---

##  Abstract

Employee attrition significantly impacts an organization's productivity and cost. Through this project, we identify key attrition drivers using data exploration and statistical analysis. Visual dashboards provide a snapshot of workforce distribution, performance, job satisfaction, and more—helping HR teams make proactive, data-driven decisions.

##  Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection:**  
   HR dataset containing employee demographic, job role, performance, and attrition details.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Null value treatment  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature selection and transformation

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Attrition trends by department, age, salary, etc.

4. **Visualization & Dashboarding:**  
   - Built a multi-page Power BI report covering:
     - Attrition Overview  
     - Departmental Analysis  
     - Performance vs Attrition  
     - Satisfaction Metrics

5. **Predictive Insights (Python):**  
   - Plots and statistical summaries to find key attrition factors  
   - Suggestions for retention strategies

## Key Visuals

- Employee Count & Attrition Rate
- Job Role vs Attrition
- Salary vs Performance Rating
- Distance from Home vs Attrition
- Age Distribution & Satisfaction Levels

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics in solving HR challenges. By using a combination of visualization tools and programming, we effectively identified patterns that contribute to employee attrition. The dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for HR managers to strategize better retention and engagement policies.
